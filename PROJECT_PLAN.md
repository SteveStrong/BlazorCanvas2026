# BlazorCanvas2026 - Multi-Phase Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
**Mission**: Create a comprehensive showcase demonstrating the progression from basic HTML5 canvas to advanced FoundryBlazor Canvas2D/3D components, solving the critical challenges of JavaScript asset management and component library integration.

**Theme**: Leveraging HTML5 Canvas in Blazor Applications

**Target Audience**: Developers evaluating canvas solutions for Blazor applications who want to see how FoundryBlazor makes complex canvas scenarios "rock solid"

---

## Current Project Status

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Foundation Solidification (COMPLETE)

- [x] Canvas state management

#### Phase 1.2: BECanvas Integration ‚úÖ 
- [x] Blazor.Extensions.Canvas implementation (`/blazorcanvas`)
- [x] Canvas2DContext C# API usage
- [x] JavaScript asset reference (`_content/Blazor.Extensions.Canvas/blazor.extensions.canvas.js`)
- [x] Animation loop integration
- [x] Component lifecycle management

#### Phase 1.3: Documentation & Troubleshooting ‚úÖ
- [x] BECANVAS_TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md created
- [x] Common pitfalls and solutions documented

---

## üîÑ Phase 2: Service Architecture & DI Resolution (IN PROGRESS)
**Goal**: Solve the service registration and JavaScript asset challenges

### ‚úÖ Phase 2.1: Basic Project Compilation (COMPLETE)
- [x] Fixed BlazorCanvas2026 compilation errors
- [x] Cleaned up broken dependencies
- [x] Created simple navigation structure
- [x] Preserved working canvas examples
- [x] **Current Status**: Project builds successfully

### üéØ Phase 2.2: Service Discovery & Registration (NEXT)
**Simple Goal**: Get Canvas2DComponent to render - push button, see activity

**Approach**: Keep it simple - minimal service registration to get basic rendering
- [ ] Analyze FoundryBlazor service dependencies (IWorkspace, IFoundryService, ComponentBus)
- [ ] Create **minimal** service registration (stub implementations if needed)
- [ ] Test Canvas2DComponent renders without errors
- [ ] Document required NuGet packages and versions

### Phase 2.3: JavaScript Asset Management
- [ ] Identify all required JavaScript files for FoundryBlazor components
- [ ] Ensure assets load properly across DLL boundaries
- [ ] Document proper `_Imports.razor` configuration
- [ ] Create asset verification utilities

### Phase 2.4: Minimal Working Example
- [ ] Canvas2DComponent renders on `/simplecanvas2d` page
- [ ] Single scene with basic shape (push button ‚Üí see shape appear)
- [ ] Verify complete service chain works

## üéØ Phase 3: Canvas2D Component Showcase (FUTURE)
**Goal**: Demonstrate production-ready 2D canvas capabilities

### Phase 3.1: Basic Canvas2D Integration
- [ ] Working Canvas2DComponent page based on `Controls/Canvas2D.razorHOLD`
- [ ] Scene management and workspace integration
- [ ] Basic shape creation (FoShape2D examples)

### Phase 3.2: Interactive Features
- [ ] Mouse interaction and hit testing
- [ ] Shape selection and manipulation
- [ ] Real-time property editing

### Phase 3.3: Animation System
- [ ] Demonstrate FoGlyph2D.Animations.Tween system
- [ ] CreateTickPlayground() implementation (spinning shape)
- [ ] SetDoTugOfWar() advanced animation example

### Phase 3.4: Pub/Sub Integration
- [ ] ComponentBus event handling
- [ ] RefreshUIEvent and TriggerRedrawEvent patterns
- [ ] Cross-component communication examples

---

## üåê Phase 4: Canvas3D Component Showcase (FUTURE)
**Goal**: Demonstrate 3D visualization capabilities

### Phase 4.1: Basic Canvas3D Integration
- [ ] Canvas3DComponent based on `Controls/Canvas3D.razorHOLD`
- [ ] BlazorThreeJS ViewerThreeD integration
- [ ] 3D scene setup and management

### Phase 4.2: 3D Interaction Features
- [ ] Camera controls and navigation
- [ ] 3D object manipulation
- [ ] Scene hierarchy management

### Phase 4.3: 2D/3D Integration
- [ ] Demonstrate hybrid 2D/3D workflows
- [ ] Data sharing between 2D and 3D views
- [ ] Synchronized scene updates

---

## üèóÔ∏è Phase 5: Advanced Integration Patterns (FUTURE)
**Goal**: Show real-world application scenarios

### Phase 5.1: Layout Integration
- [ ] Implement Drawing.razorHOLD layout pattern
- [ ] RadzenSplitter and responsive design
- [ ] Tree view integration (DesignTreeView, ShapeTreeView)

### Phase 5.2: Multi-Scene Management
- [ ] Multiple canvas instances
- [ ] Scene switching and state management
- [ ] Performance optimization patterns

---

## üìö Phase 6: Developer Experience & Documentation (FUTURE)
**Goal**: Make adoption seamless for other developers

### Phase 6.1: Setup Guides
- [ ] Step-by-step integration guide
- [ ] NuGet package installation instructions
- [ ] Service registration cookbook

### Phase 6.2: JavaScript Asset Guide
- [ ] Asset debugging techniques
- [ ] Common deployment issues and solutions
- [ ] Browser dev tools usage patterns

### Phase 6.3: Performance & Best Practices
- [ ] Canvas performance optimization
- [ ] Memory management patterns
- [ ] Production deployment considerations

## Key Success Principles

**Keep It Simple**: 
- Focus on getting controls to render and animate
- Push button ‚Üí see activity
- Don't overcomplicate features

**JavaScript Asset Management**:
- Critical challenge: ensuring JS assets work across DLL boundaries
- Foundation must be rock solid before adding complexity

**Progressive Complexity**:
- Start with basic rendering
- Add interaction gradually
- Build up to sophisticated scenarios

**Real Working Examples**:
- Based on proven patterns from `Controls/*.razorHOLD` files
- Copy-paste ready code for developers
- Clear value proposition over lower-level approaches

---

## Current Focus: Phase 2.2
**Immediate Goal**: Get Canvas2DComponent to render on the `/simplecanvas2d` page

**Success Criteria**: 
- Page loads without errors
- Canvas2DComponent appears
- Basic button interaction works
- Foundation ready for adding shapes and animations

**Next Steps**:
1. Minimal FoundryBlazor service registration
2. Test Canvas2DComponent renders
3. Add simple shape creation (push button ‚Üí see shape)
4. Document the working pattern
